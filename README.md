# Home Assistant Windows 10 inspired themes

> By Milan Korenica - mikosoft83

Here are 49 themes based on Windows 10 look. All the themes are the same apart for accent color and support light/dark mode selection (if you are using HA version older than 2021.6 only light mode will be available). All the colors are taken straight from Windows 10 accent color picker and UI elements. 

Themes style:

- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
- [Bar card](https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card) (available also in HACS)
- [Time picker](https://github.com/GeorgeSG/lovelace-time-picker-card) (also in HACS)

Themes are supercharged using [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)! Elements styled are:

- Badges
- Fonts
- More info dialog
- [Vacuum card](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card) by Denys Dovhan
- [Mini graph card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card) by kalkih
- [Sonos card](https://github.com/punxaphil/custom-sonos-card) by punxaphil

I highly recommend installing card-mod (available in HACS) to fully embrace this theme.
